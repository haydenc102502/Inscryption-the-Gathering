Installing the Set:


Download and install Cockatrice.

Download Inscrpyption.xml and images folder.

In Cockatrice, use Card Database→Add custom sets/cards, navigate to the unzipped folder, and select Inscryption.xml.
If you’re updating to a newer version, and have previously installed a copy of this xml file, you should use 
Card Database→Open custom sets folder and delete the existing MarioTheGathering.xml first.

In Cockatrice, use Card Database→Open custom image folder
Copy all images from the unzipped images folder into the CUSTOM images folder you opened in the previous step.
This is also necessary when updating from a previous version of the card set.

Restart Cockatrice.
